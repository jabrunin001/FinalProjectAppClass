# Traffic Analytics Application

This README provides an overview of the Traffic Analytics application, designed to predict traffic accident outcomes based on various factors. The application is built using Flask for the backend, incorporates machine learning for predictions, and is deployable on AWS infrastructure. Monitoring is set up with Prometheus and Grafana, and security considerations are outlined and implemented throughout the project.

## Project Structure

The application consists of several components organized into directories for clarity and manageability:

- `src/`: Source code directory for the Flask web application.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the Flask application.
- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.
- `.circleci/config.yml`: CircleCI configuration for CI/CD.
- `infra/`: Terraform scripts for AWS infrastructure provisioning.
- `monitoring/`: Configuration files for Prometheus and Grafana.
- `security/`: Security policy definitions for IAM roles and permissions.
- `data/`: SQL schema definitions for Amazon Redshift and scripts for data loading.
- `env/`: Environment-specific configurations.
- `docs/`: Project documentation.

## Features

- Predictive analytics on traffic accidents using machine learning.
- Continuous Integration and Deployment with GitHub Actions or CircleCI.
- Data storage in Amazon Redshift.
- Cloud-native monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Comprehensive security measures including IAM roles and encrypted data.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- AWS CLI
- Terraform

For detailed setup instructions, refer to [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md).

## Usage

To use the application, send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the necessary data payload. For more information, see [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md).

## Architecture

The application utilizes a Flask backend, hosted on AWS EC2 instances, with data storage in Amazon Redshift. Machine learning predictions are generated using a model trained on historical traffic data. Monitoring is implemented via Prometheus and Grafana. For a detailed architectural overview, consult [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Security

Security is a core aspect of the application, with policies governing access and interactions with AWS services. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. For more information on security measures, see [`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md).

## Monitoring

Prometheus is used for collecting application metrics, with Grafana providing a visualization layer. For details on the monitoring setup and how to configure alerting, refer to [`docs/monitoring.md`](docs/monitoring.md).

## CI/CD

The project incorporates CI/CD pipelines using either GitHub Actions or CircleCI, automating tests, builds, and deployments. Configuration files are provided for both services.
